## Session 1: Research

**Automated Concept Identification**

**Purpose:** Identify 20-25 specific concepts to learn today.

**Duration:** <1 minute (automated)

**You Do:**

- Provide learning goal and building goal
- Review the concept list
- Verify scope feels right
- Adjust if needed

**AI Does:**

- Breaks broad goal into 20-25 specific concepts
- Generates one-sentence definitions (WHAT, not HOW)
- Finds 3-5 quality resources per domain
- Creates 3-5 preliminary organizational groups
- Checks Knowledge MCP for what you already know

**Key Point:** Creates a shopping list, not a meal. Identifies ingredients without cooking them.

---

## Session 2: Morning Recap

**Prior Knowledge Activation + Yesterday's Review**

**Purpose:** Prepare your brain by activating related concepts and reviewing yesterday's learning.

**Duration:** 5-10 minutes (reading)

**You Do:**

- Read recaps of 8-12 related concepts from your past
- Review all concepts from yesterday (20-25 typically)
- Attempt 3-5 retrieval questions about yesterday
- Check your answers

**AI Does:**

- Searches Knowledge MCP for concepts related to today's topics
- Retrieves ALL concepts learned yesterday
- Writes 2-3 sentence reminders for each
- Generates retrieval questions (recall, comparison, application)
- Creates motivating primer summary

**Key Point:** The 12-hour post-sleep review is the most important spacing interval. This single review can improve 1-week retention by 40-60%.

---

## Session 3: AIM (Activate-Integrate-Motivate)

**Structure Creation Through Chunking**

**Purpose:** Organize 20-25 concepts into meaningful chunks and generate guiding questions.

**Duration:** 10-20 minutes

**You Do:**

- Read minimal 2-3 sentence overviews of each concept
- Group concepts into 3-5 meaningful chunks
- Name each chunk and explain your logic
- Generate 2 questions per concept (why important, how relates)
- Identify 3-5 most foundational concepts
- Sketch rough mind map

**AI Does:**

- Provides minimal concept overviews (WHAT it is only)
- Asks Socratic questions to prompt your thinking
- Provides question templates
- Verifies your chunking logic is sound
- Suggests if chunks are too large/small

**Key Point:** You decide the organization. The struggle to structure material is part of learning. AI provides scaffolding, not answers.

---

## Session 4: SHOOT (Deep Encoding)

**Two-Pass Learning**

**Purpose:** Build deep understanding through active encoding.

**Duration:** 90-120 minutes

**You Do:**

**Pass 1 (40 min):**

- Read/watch resources for all concepts
- Immediately self-explain each concept
- Answer "why important" from memory
- Note relationships you notice
- Rate difficulty (1-5)
- Identify 8-10 hardest concepts

**Pass 2 (40-80 min):**

- Deep dive on hard concepts only
- Read multiple sources for different perspectives
- Generate your own examples
- Create analogies
- Map relationships to other concepts
- Struggle with confusing parts (ask AI only after 3-5 min)

**AI Does:**

- Provides information ONLY when requested
- Waits for your explanation attempt first
- Asks strategic questions after you struggle 3-5 minutes
- Verifies accuracy of your understanding
- Provides examples AFTER you attempt generation
- Suggests different sources if truly stuck
- Maintains 3:1 questions-to-answers ratio

**Key Point:** This session should feel challenging (~90% brain engagement). If it feels easy, you're not encoding deeply enough. Struggle is the mechanism of learning.

## Session 5: SKIN (Verification & Batching)

**Retrieval-Based Quality Control**

**Purpose:** Verify understanding through memory retrieval and organize concepts for storage.

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes

**You Do:**

- Explain each concept from memory (no notes)
- Include how it works, relationships, examples
- Propose classification (area, topic, subtopic)
- Self-assess confidence before AI feedback
- Receive feedback on accuracy
- Re-explain corrected version

**AI Does:**

- Waits for complete explanation without interrupting
- Evaluates accuracy against reliable sources
- Identifies specific correct and incorrect parts
- Explains misconceptions clearly
- Assigns objective confidence score (0-100)
- Groups concepts into 3-5 semantic batches of 5-7 concepts
- Names each batch with theme

**Key Point:** Quality control checkpoint. Retrieval from memory is itself a powerful learning tool that reveals gaps and strengthens understanding.

---

## Session 6: Storing

**Automated Storage to Knowledge MCP**

**Purpose:** Mechanically save verified concepts to permanent storage.

**Duration:** 2-3 minutes per batch (automated)

**You Do:**

- Trigger storage for each batch
- Review results to confirm success
- Verify all batches completed

**AI Does:**

- Reads batch file
- Calls Knowledge MCP to create concepts with metadata
- Creates relationships between concepts
- Handles errors (retry once, then report)
- Generates confirmation file

**Key Point:** Purely mechanical data transfer. No cognitive work. Concepts become permanently available for future sessions.

---

## Session 7: Code Teacher

**Calibrated Building Assistance**

**Purpose:** Provide help while building that matches your knowledge level.

**Duration:** Conversational (available throughout 4-5 hour building time)

**You Do:**

- Build projects applying today's learning
- Struggle appropriately (try 5+ min before asking)
- Ask questions when stuck
- Attempt solutions before requesting help
- Engage with hints rather than demanding answers

**AI Does:**

- Queries Knowledge MCP and today's learning to check what you know
- Calibrates help level based on confidence scores:
  - **High confidence (>85%) or learned today:** Minimal help - Socratic questions only
  - **Medium confidence (50-85%):** Moderate help - structured hints and examples after attempts
  - **Low confidence (<50%) or unknown:** Comprehensive help - teaching + guided practice
- Maintains context of what you're building
- Asks 3:1 questions to answers when possible

**Key Point:** Help level adjusts dynamically. Too much help wastes learning opportunity. Too little causes unproductive frustration. Calibration is critical.

## Session 8: Weekly Recap

**Spaced Interleaved Retrieval Practice**

**Purpose:** Combat forgetting through retrieval at optimal intervals.

**Duration:** 60 minutes weekly

**You Do:**

- Answer 20-60 retrieval questions from memory
- Mix of question types: recall, application, comparison, teaching
- Struggle to retrieve if needed
- Review correct answer after each attempt
- Note which were easy vs hard

**AI Does:**

- Queries Knowledge MCP for concepts at 2, 7, 14, 30 days ago
- Filters by confidence (prioritizes 50-85% range)
- Creates interleaved sequence (mixes time periods and topics)
- Generates varied question types
- Provides immediate feedback
- Updates confidence scores based on retrieval success
- Identifies weak/strong areas

**Key Point:** Scientifically-validated spacing intervals (2, 7, 14, 30 days). Interleaved practice produces 2-3x better retention than blocked practice. Without this, you'll forget 80% within 2 weeks.

## Core Principles

### The 80-90% Rule

You must do 80-90% of cognitive work. AI assists without doing your thinking. If learning feels easy, AI is doing too much.

### Generation Before Reception

You always attempt first, AI responds second. Create your own explanations, examples, analogies before receiving them.

### Productive Struggle

Struggle for 3-5 minutes before asking for help. This difficulty is desirable - it's the mechanism that creates learning.

### Socratic Questioning

AI asks questions more than providing answers (3:1 ratio when possible). Strategic hints guide discovery rather than replace it.

### Strategic Assistance

Help is calibrated to your actual knowledge state. Recently learned concepts get minimal help to encourage application. Unknown concepts get comprehensive teaching.

### Memory-Based Verification

Understanding is verified through retrieval from memory, not recognition. Explaining without notes reveals what you actually learned.

---

## Why This Works

**Cognitive Science Foundation:**

- **Desirable difficulties** create stronger learning than easy reception
- **Retrieval practice** is more powerful than re-reading or reviewing
- **Spaced repetition** at specific intervals (12 hours, 2, 7, 14, 30 days) combats forgetting curve
- **Elaborative interrogation** (asking "why" repeatedly) builds deeper understanding
- **Interleaved practice** creates better long-term retention than blocked practice
- **Self-explanation** forces active processing and reveals gaps

**The Result:**
Exceptional long-term retention with efficient time investment. You'll remember what you learn and be able to apply it confidently.
